In this part we want to provide several more complicated lessons. We want to
give you some useful ideas.

## Visualisation of Your Results

Lessons ["Taking a Photo"]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-04-2 %}) and
["Recording a Video"]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-04-4 %}) are very
important because it is very useful to show the results in graphic mode. You
can prepare posters or videos for conference or meeting using this data. Visual
information can also attract more people to robotics.

## Using Existing Code

We want to show how you can combine several ros nodes for your goal. In lesson
["Following the Route Using Code"]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-04-5 %})
you will create ros node with functionality: go to the position and take a
photo. You do not have to control how TurtleBot will take photo. We can combine
ros nodes together like functions in python script.

## User Interface

We also understand that application have to be easy to use. In the Gazebo
Concert lesson series we provide you a quick look at rocon project and creating
user application.

[We need your help]({{ site.url }}/about/)! You can write what tutorial do you
need. If your know anything interesting you can share your knowledge by
creating a lesson.

Letâ€™s start our lessons. We wish you productive study hours!
