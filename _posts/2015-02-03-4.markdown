## What is Kinect?
{% include image_onrightoftext.html img="/assets/sim_kinect_camera.png" width="225" %}

Kinect consists of three parts that work together: an RGB camera, a depth sensor, and a multi-array microphone. The TurtleBot uses Kinect to see the world in 3D and for detecting and tracking objects.

## Prerequisites

First of all, make sure you have the openni packages installed:
{% highlight sh %}
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni-*
{% endhighlight %}

You can check the active 3D sensor of TurtleBot by running:
{% highlight sh %}
echo $TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR
{% endhighlight %}

You have the right active 3D sensor if you see `kinect`. If you see `asus_xtion_pro` or something else you will need to set another value in `.bashrc`:
{% highlight sh %}
echo "export TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR=kinect" >> .bashrc
{% endhighlight %}

or run this command in every new terminal:
{% highlight sh %}
TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR=kinect
{% endhighlight %}
